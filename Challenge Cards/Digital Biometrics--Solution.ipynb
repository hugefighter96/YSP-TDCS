    "What’s the biggest risk if biometric data is leaked? (Hint: you can change your password, but not your face.)\n",

    "Biometric data is individual physical or behavioral characteristics used to recognize individuals. Examples include fingerprints, facial recognition, voice patterns, and even your typing or walking pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyday use examples include using a fingerprint or face scan to unlock your phone, facial recognition for pictures, or voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where is this data stored?\n",
    "It varies with the system. Most smartphones (such as iPhones) save biometric information locally within a secure chip. A few apps or services save this information to cloud servers, raising privacy concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Highest risk if compromised:\n",
    "Biometric information is unchangeable — you can update a password, but you cannot alter your face or fingerprints. Leaked, it can be used for identity theft or unauthorized tracking with lifetime repercussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-life incident:\n",
    "In 2018, a report came out that the online access to India's Aadhaar database (which contains fingerprints and iris scans of more than a billion individuals) was for sale for as cheap as $7.\n"
